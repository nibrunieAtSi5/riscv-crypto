Description:: 
This instruction implements a single round of the forward AES-128 KeySchedule.
It treats each 128-bit element group of `vs2` as the current AES round key.
The round constant index of the KeySchedule operation is stored in the 5-bit `rcon`
immediate.

It applies a single AES-128 KeySchedule round to each element group, and
writes the 128-bit result to the corresponding element group in `vd`.

This instruction only returns the generated key to the same element group as the source.
If it is desired to have the same key in all vector groups, either the input vector groups
need to contain the same values, or the output from a particular group needs to be "broadcast"
to the other groups using an instruction such as vrgather.

This instruction treats `EEW=32` and `EGS=4`, regardless of `vtype.vsew`
In order to properly specify the number of elements, vl needs to be set to
vl = `vtype.vsew`/128. If `vstart` is not zero, it needs to be scaled similarly.
This instruction requires that `Zvl128b` be implemented (i.e `VLEN>=128`).




Operation::
[source,pseudocode]
--
function clause execute (VAESESFK1(rcon, vs2)) = {
  assert(VLEN>=128);
  vlen = vl/EGS * vtype.SEW/EEW
  foreach (i from vlstart to vlen) {
    let current : bits(128) = get_velem(vs2, EGW=128, i);
    let next    : bits(128) = aes_128_forward_key_schedule(rcon, current);
    set_velem(vd, EGW=128, i, next);
  }
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
