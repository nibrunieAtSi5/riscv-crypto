Description::
Performs 2 rounds of SM3 Compression, producing eight 32-bit outputs in
a 256-bit 8-element group.

The round number is provided by the unsigned 5-bit `rnds` unsigned immediate. Legal values are 0 - 31
and indicate which group of two rounds are being performed. For example, if rnds=1,
then rounds 2 and 3 are being performed.

[NOTE]
====
The round number is used in the rotation of the constant as well to inform the
behavior which differs between rounds 0-15, and rounds 16-63.
====

It treats each 256-bit 8-element group of `vd` as eight 32-bit words,
and each 256-bit 8-element group of `vs2` as eight 32-bit words. Only 4 of these words are consumed by
this instruction, the rest are don't-cares.

vs2 = {w[j], w[j+1], w[j+2], w[j+3], w[j+4], w[j+5], w[j+6], w[j+7]}

The values consumed by the instruction are

vs2 = {w[j], w[j+1], -, -, w[j+4], w[j+5], -, -}

Where the "-" characters are not consumed and are therefore don't cares.

This instruction consumes the "W" message schedule inputs and internally generates the "W'" values as needed



// NB::
// It probably makes sense to have vs1 and vs2 hold eight 32-bit words each and have 4 versions of this instruction;
// one for each pair of inputs.
// This fits more naturally with the generating instructions and doesn't leave us with the oddity of 64-bit and 256-bit element groups
// Vd (in) = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}
// vs1 = W[0:7]  // 8 expanded words
// vs2 = Wâ€™[0:7] // 8 expanded words with XORing
// Vd (out) = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}




This instruction treats `EEW=32` regardless of `vtype.vsew`
`vl` needs to be set to eight times the number of element groups.
If vstart is not zero, it needs to be scaled similarly.
This instruction requires that `Zvl128b` be implemented (i.e `VLEN>=128`).

Operation::

--
function clause execute (VSM3C(rnd, vs2)) = {
  assert((vl%EGS)<>0)       // vl must be a multiple of EGS
  assert((vstart%EGS)<>0) //  vstart must be a multiple of EGS

  eg_len = (vl/EGS)
  eg_start = (vstart/EGS)
  
  foreach (i from eg_start to eg_len-1) {


  // your code goes here
  SS1 <- ROTL7((ROTL12(A) + E + (ROTLjmod32(T_j))
  SS2 <- SS1 xor ROTL12(A)
