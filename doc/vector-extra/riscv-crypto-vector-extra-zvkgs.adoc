=== `Zvkgs` - Vector-Scalar GCM/GMAC

`Zvkgs` depends on `Zvkg`, it extends the existing `vghsh.vv` and `vgmul.vv` instructions with new vector-scalar variants: `vghsh.vs` and `vgmul.vs`.

Instructions to enable the efficient implementation of parallel versions of GHASH~H~ which is used in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and
Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).

The instructions inherit the same constraints (element group size, data independent execution timing and `vl`/`vstart` multiple constraints).

All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups comprised of four 32-bit elements.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.

The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
`vl` must be set to the number of `SEW=32` elements to be processed and
therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=4`. +
Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=4`.
