[[crypto_vector_extensions]]
== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the extensions in the Additional Vector Cryptography 
Instruction Set Extension Specification.


All the Additional Vector Crypto Extensions can be built
on _any_ embedded (Zve*) or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

// See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>> for more details on vector element groups and the drawbacks of
// small `VLEN` values.


As the instructions defined in this specification might be used to implement cryptographic primitives
 they may be implemented with data-independent execution latencies as
defined in the
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1-scalar[RISC-V Scalar Cryptography Extensions specification].

If `Zvkt` is implemented, all the instructions from `Zvbc32e` (`vclmul[h].[vv,vx]`) 
shall be executed with data-independent execution latency.

Whether `Zvkt` is implemented or not, all instructions from `Zvkgs` (`vgmul.vs`, `vghsh.vs`)
shall be executed with data-independent execution latency.


Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.
