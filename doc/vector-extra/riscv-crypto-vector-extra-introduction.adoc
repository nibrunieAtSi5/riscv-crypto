== Introduction

This document describes the proposed _additional_ _vector_ cryptography
extensions for RISC-V.
Those extensions extend the _vector_ cryptography extensions for RISC-V,
providing additional features.
Those extensions aim at either enabling some use cases (e.g. carry-less multiply on 32-bit vector implementations)
or enabling more efficient implementations of some algorithms (e.g. CRC, AES-GCM).
All instructions proposed here are based on the Vector registers.
