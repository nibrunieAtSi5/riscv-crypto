== Introduction

This document describes the proposed _vector_ _extra_ cryptography
extensions for RISC-V.
Those extensions extend the _vector_ cryptography extensions for RISC-V,
providing extra features not mandatory for a high performace implementation but which
can help further improve the efficiency of the algorithms that use them.
All instructions proposed here are based on the Vector registers.
