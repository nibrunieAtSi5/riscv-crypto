== Introduction

This document describes the proposed _additional_ _vector_ cryptography
extensions for RISC-V.
Those extensions extend the _vector_ cryptography extensions for RISC-V,
providing additional features not mandatory for a high performace implementation but which
can help further improve the efficiency some algorithms (e.g. CRC, AES-GCM).
All instructions proposed here are based on the Vector registers.
